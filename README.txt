This lightweight Homey device application adds support through MQTT protocol for Watts Live energy meters. 

It uses Menno van Grinsven's MQTT Client to communicate with an MQTT broker, so the client should be already installed and configured.

By default the Watts Live device does not include production data, i.e. in case of having solar power, but these metrics can be enabled from driver settings after installing the driver.
